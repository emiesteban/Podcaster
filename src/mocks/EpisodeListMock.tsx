            "description": "If you’ve ever learned classical piano, you probably tried to play one of Bach’s Inventions. The composer wrote fifteen pieces containing the most important fifteen keys in order to teach his son the fundamentals of piano and composition. Today, they remain some of the most popular pieces of piano music. Acclaimed jazz pianist Dan Tepfer recently revisited his childhood music books seeing them in a way he’d never realized as a student: the Inventions are much more than novice piano works.\n\nFor Tepfer, each of the Inventions not only highlight masterful command over harmony and counterpoint, but also contain moving character arcs that resemble the hero’s journey. A character is introduced at home in place of safety in act I. And then they are thrust into chaos and must overcome unsurmountable challenges in Act II. Finally, in Act III, our hero overcomes their final battle and returns home transformed by the journey. Once Tepfer heard this character arc, he started to apply it to his own free improv.\n\nThrough studying Bach, Tepfer conceived a new album: Inventions / Reinventions. In this project Tepfer fills in the missing keys from the Bach to complete all twenty four keys (there are twelve major and twelve minor keys) while updating the music with modern improvisation. In this conversation Tepfer walks co-host Charlie Harding through his process of playing Bach and applying it to jazz improv.\n\nListen to Dan Tepfer’s Inventions / Reinventions on StorySound Records\nListen to Into It with Sam Sanders on Fair Use\nLearn more about your ad choices.

            "description": "Everyone will describe the music of 100 gecs differently. To some, Dylan Brady and Laura Les make deeply satisfying earworms, tracks able to scratch the itches that occupy the deepest memory-holed corners of the brain. To others, though, their music is an \"anarchic assault on the ears,” a quilt of all of the genres historically ridiculed in the popular canon: nu-metal, scuzz-rock, ska and 90’s pop punk are all fair game in the world of gecs.\n\nOn their latest record, aptly titled 10000 gecs, Brady and Les double down on the crunchy distortion and harmonics, creating tracks equally influenced by Primus and Eddie Van Halen as they are by their hyperpop contemporaries. The album reflects a Internet-core approach to music as a whole, shedding notions of “good” and “bad” music in favor of catchy melodies and intricate song construction. \n\nOn this episode on Switched On Pop, we dig deep into the ethos of 100 gecs, and producer Reanna Cruz talks to the duo themselves about their eclectic sophomore record.\n\nSongs discussed: \n\n\n100 gecs – Hollywood Baby\n\n100 gecs – Billy Knows Jamie\n\n100 gecs – stupid horse\n\n100 gecs – 745 sticky\n\n100 gecs – Doritos & Fritos\n\nPrimus – Jerry Was A Racecar Driver\n\nWeen – Bananas and Blow\n\nLimp Bizkit – My Generation\n\nGorillaz – Dirty Harry\n\nFuture – I Been Drinking\n\nJ-Kwon – Tipsy\n\nJustin Timberlake – Summer Love\n\nViolent Femmes – Added Up\n\n100 gecs – Dumbest Girl Alive\n\nTHX Deep Note\n\nCypress Hill – Insane in the Membrane\n\n100 gecs – The Most Wanted Person in the United States\n\n100 gecs – Frog on the Floor\n\nAlan Jackson – Chattahoochee\n\nLimp Bizkit – Dad Vibes\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
